We can all agree that the way we spend the time during high school has the power to shape our life forward. However, not all teenagers have the capacity to access the same learning possibilities. Unfortunately, talent is universal - opportunity is not.

The main mission of Empower The Youth was to empower high school students learn new skills, develop various projects and thus, involve themselves in various opportunities (including but not limited to competitions, internships, fellowships, etc.). Coming from a low-income background, I was extremely grateful to have received a full scholarship for a private science high school where I was constantly informed about all the chances I can take. However, my peers enrolled in public high school never had an access to the same opportunities.

Inspired by the situation, Empower The Youth, offered a full list of activities high school students in North Macedonia can pursue. Additionally, it involved stream-lined lessons to assist students in their preparations for international competitions and science fairs.

# Empower The Food

Within the same application, we were tackling the food problem present in Struga, North Macedonia. Every day, an immense amount of food is thrown away, and on the other side, we constantly have people who don't have enough food. Empower the Food was doing a simple redirection of the food from hotels, cafes, restaurants, and supermarkets to socially endangered families. On one side, we've logged in all interested socially endangered families in the region. On the other, we've assigned each one of the partner organizations to be responsible for a specific number of families. Red Cross Volunteers helped the process of food delivery.

Both parts of the application were created through Java for front-end and Firebase for back-end. The application was in use till March 2020, when we had to terminate our food-sharing program due to the pandemic.
