# Empower The Youth
We can all agree that the way we spend the time during high school has the power to shape our life forward. However, not all teenagers have the capacity to access the same learning possibilities. Unfortunately, talent is universal - opportunity is not.

The main mission of Empower The Youth was to empower high school students learn new skills, develop various projects and thus, involve themselves in various opportunities (including but not limited to competitions, internships, fellowships, etc.). Coming from a low-income background, I was extremely grateful to have received a full scholarship for a private science high school where I was constantly informed about all the chances I can take. However, my peers enrolled in public high school never had an access to the same opportunities.

Inspired by the situation, Empower The Youth, offered a full list of activities high school students in North Macedonia can pursue. Additionally, it involved stream-lined lessons to assist students in their preparations for international competitions and science fairs.
